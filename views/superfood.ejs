<h1>Superfoods</h1>

<p>
    Nutritionally speaking, there is no such thing as a superfood.

The term was coined for marketing purposes to influence food trends and sell products.

The food industry bestows the superfood label on nutrient-rich foods with a supposed capacity to positively affect health.

Though many foods could be described as super, it’s important to understand that there is no single food that holds the key to good health or disease prevention.

But since the term “superfood” doesn’t seem to be going anywhere anytime soon, it may be worth taking a closer look at some healthy options.

Here are 5 super foods that may be worthy of the esteemed superfood title.

<h2>1. Dark Leafy Greens</h2>
<p>
    Dark green leafy vegetables (DGLVs) are an excellent source of nutrients including folate, zinc, calcium, iron, magnesium, vitamin C and fiber.

Part of what makes DGLVs so super is their potential to reduce your risk of chronic illnesses including heart disease and type 2 diabetes (1Trusted Source, 2Trusted Source).

They also contain high levels of anti-inflammatory compounds known as carotenoids, which may protect against certain types of cancer (3Trusted Source).

Some well-known DGLVs include:

Kale
Swiss chard
Collard greens
Turnip greens
Spinach
Some DGLVs have a bitter taste and not everyone enjoys them plain. You can get creative by including them in your favorite soups, salads, smoothies, stir-fries and curries.

<h2>2. Berries</h2>
<p>
Berries are a nutritional powerhouse of vitamins, minerals, fiber and antioxidants.

The strong antioxidant capacity of berries is associated with a reduced risk of heart disease, cancer and other inflammatory conditions (4Trusted Source, 5Trusted Source).

Berries may also be effective in treating various digestive and immune-related disorders when used alongside traditional medical therapies (6Trusted Source).

Some of the most common berries include:

Raspberries
Strawberries
Blueberries
Blackberries
Cranberries
Whether you enjoy them as part of your breakfast, as a dessert, on a salad or in a smoothie, the health benefits of berries are as versatile as their culinary applications.

<h2>3. Green Tea</h2>
<p>
    Originally from China, green tea is a lightly caffeinated beverage with a wide array of medicinal properties.

    Green tea is rich in antioxidants and polyphenolic compounds which have strong anti-inflammatory effects. One of the most prevalent antioxidants in green tea is the catechin epigallocatechin gallate, or EGCG.
    
    EGCG is likely what gives green tea its apparent ability to protect against chronic diseases including heart disease, diabetes and cancer (7Trusted Source, 8Trusted Source).
    
    Research also indicates that the combination of catechins and caffeine in green tea may make it an effective tool for weight loss in some people (9Trusted Source).

<h2>4. Eggs</h2>
<p>
    Eggs have historically been a controversial topic in the nutrition world due to their high cholesterol content, but they remain one of the healthiest foods.

Whole eggs are rich in many nutrients including B vitamins, choline, selenium, vitamin A, iron and phosphorus.

They’re also loaded with high-quality protein.

Eggs contain two potent antioxidants, zeaxanthin and lutein, which are known to protect vision and eye health (10Trusted Source, 11Trusted Source).

Despite fears surrounding egg consumption and high cholesterol, research indicates no measurable increase in heart disease or diabetes risk from eating up to 6–12 eggs per week (12Trusted Source).

In fact, eating eggs could increase “good” HDL cholesterol in some people, which may lead to a favorable reduction in heart disease risk. More research is needed to draw a definite conclusion (13Trusted Source).

<h2>5. Legumes
</h2>

<p>
    Legumes, or pulses, are a class of plant foods made up of beans (including soy), lentils, peas, peanuts and alfalfa.

They earn the superfood label because they’re loaded with nutrients and play a role in preventing and managing various diseases.

Legumes are a rich source of B vitamins, various minerals, protein and fiber.

Research indicates that they offer many health benefits including improved type 2 diabetes management, as well as reduced blood pressure and cholesterol (14Trusted Source).

Eating beans and legumes regularly may also promote healthy weight maintenance, due to their ability to improve feelings of fullness (15Trusted Source).
